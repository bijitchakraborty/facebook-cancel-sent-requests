# Facebook Bulk Cancel Sent Friend Requests

This script helps you cancel all sent friend requests on Facebook at once.

## How to Use

1. Go to [Facebook Friend Requests](https://www.facebook.com/friends/requests)
2. Click "View sent requests"
3. Manually scroll down to load all requests you want to cancel
4. Open the browser console (press F12)
5. Paste and run the code from `cancel-requests.js`

**Note:** Do not use auto-scrolling. Use at your own risk.

## Why Manual Scrolling?
Auto-scrolling scripts may trigger Facebook's anti-bot measures, potentially restricting your account. Manual scrolling is safer.
